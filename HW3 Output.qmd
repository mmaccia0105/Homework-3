## Task 1

###Question a: Why `read_csv` cannot be used to read the data.txt file

The function `read_csv()` can only be used to read in files that use the delimeters of commas or tabs. The function `read_csv2()` must be used in files with semicolons as the separator (commas can be used for decimal points).



```{r}
data <- read_csv2('~/ST558 Repo/Homework3/Data/data.txt',
                  col_names= TRUE)
data
```

###Question b: Reading in 2nd file

In this file, "6" is the delimeter.

```{r}
data_2 <- read_delim('~/ST558 Repo/Homework3/Data/data2.txt',
                     delim = '6',
                     col_types= 'fdc')

data_2
```
